## Project description

An interactive short fiction, which assigns a value to your choices and then scores accordingly, resulting in a judgement. ie, you win / you have been dissolved in acid / you are a loser etc. 

## Goals for Version 1

a few paragraphs and a simple choice system which results in the finale and a final numerical score

## Libraries / Other Technology Needed

No idea. 

## Risks

Either it will be too complex or i will run out of time.
to combat this, i need to keep it as simple as possible at the beginning, and to FIND THE TIME.
